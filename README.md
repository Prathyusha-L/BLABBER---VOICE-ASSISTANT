Artificial Intelligence personal assistants have become ample in the course of the most recent couple of years. Applications, for example, Siri, Bixby, Ok Google and Cortana make cell phone clients' day by day schedules that a lot simpler. You might be asking yourself how these capacities.

This assistant that is exclusively built for the people who are looking for music, who wants to stay update with news and want a touch of sarcastic jokes during their stressful day. There is no assistant that is directly present in a smart watch and connects itself with the smart watch health fitness feature.
